# nikuk1-note-taker

## Description 

This idea was introduced to me by U of A's web development boot camp program.
Base starter code was provided, and I am expected to achieve the expected result.

"Your challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. 
This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.  
The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku."_(Source: u of a)

_Creating a README_
Description:
Explain the What, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

Badges:
Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
<br />
Contributing:
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.
